  <h1>MEMORIES!!!</h1> <br>
  <p>
    Everytime I think back to when I first met you, one of my first thoughts is always: <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #29472a;">
    "Wow, has it only really been 5 months?" <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Seriously, I cannot fathom that I haven't even known you half a year. It feels like an entire lifetime. <br>
    I've made so many memories with you already. Here is some of my favorites (In no particular order):
  </p>

  - You messaged me on Bumble <br>
  - Our long (and I mean, really long) talks while we were getting to know each other <br>
  - The first time we met. The longest hug ever! Going to Graham Soda Shop, getting custard, carving pumpkins, the first time we kissed <br>
  - Your wonderful surprise basket. <br>
  - Realizing you wanted to come over a second time (surprising!) <br>
  - Going to Chili's for the first time (Wings addiction and street corn addiction!) <br>
  - RAZZLES!!! <br>
  - Your birthday party! Watching Twilight for the first time! Meeting all your pets and your family! <br>
  - Watching New Moon and Eclipse <br>
  - Christmas day. Your beautiful card, the gifts, asking me out. <br>
  - Showing me your poetry (Still haven't seen your story yet btw) <br>
  - Being able to be silly together. Making up songs and roleplaying together. How could I ever forget "Put your butt on the street and wipe", <br>
  birds nosediving into people, our Cool Cat impressions, fish fucking, our small town roleplay at Ferraras, and so much more. <br>
  - Going bowling, the arcade, TGIFridays (AND IT WAS ON MONDAY!) <br>
  - "PO KAY MON" - You <br>
  - Watching Pokemon Concierge together, Indigo League, opening packs, playing the card game, looking at cards together! <br>
  - Creating our notebook together. Your beautiful poem <br>
  - Playing so many board games! <br>
  - The cat cafe! Do you still remember their names? I bet Droopy Snowman misses us! <br>
  - Shopping together! Antique Stores! <br>
  - Watching you work! (The free lemonade didn't hurt either ;) ) <br>
  - ALL THE CUDDLINGGGG, KISSINNGGG, and and HUGGGGGSSSS, sinful actions (:<, andddddd YOUUUUUU <br>
  - Just being with you! Even in silence, even when you are sleeping, even when you are far away. Knowing i'm just yours. <br>

    I can't wait to share more memories with you baby. This is just the very beginning of our journey together. <br>
    Speaking of memories, another thing I am grateful for is all the photos we have taken together (although we really need more). <br>
    I compiled some of my favorites on the next page!  <br>
