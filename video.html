<p>A tale that grows as fast as it started</p>
<p>When a union began and the rain clouds were parted</p>
<p>Two birds flying on two different paths</p>
<p>Happened to meet one October at last</p>
<p>Twas unexpected, but this caused neither to worry</p>
<p>The flight should be fun when they needn't not hurry</p>
<p>For they've get a friend in which they can confide</p>
<p>And someone to lean on right by their side</p>
<p>As the birds find the right tree to perch their nest in</p>
<p>The brave pair are left with just one question</p>
<p>How did we get so lucky for fate to align</p>
<p>For me to be yours and you to be mine?</p>
